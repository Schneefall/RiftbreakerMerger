# RiftbreakerMerger
Tool to merge modded files for The Riftbreaker.

## How to use

Place the .exe in the main riftbreaker directory. Run the .exe.  
It will attempt to merge modded versions of the files:
- "scripts/research/research_tree.rt"
- "scripts/research/research_tree_prologue.rt"
- "scripts/research/research_tree_survival.rt"
- "scripts/blueprint_tables/weapon_stats.dat"

by recursively adding new and updating existing values, so the load-order still matters.
The merging will only consider values in modded files that are different from the base game, to prevent mods overwriting each other with default values.
This behavior is disabled if the mod provides a .merge version of the file, so it is still possible to intentionally forward base game values.
It is currently not possible to remove values.
The results are packed into "zzz_ResearchMerge.zip".  

## For Mod Authors

Mod authors can provide a .merge file, e.g. "scripts/research/research_tree.rt.merge", containing only the intended changed for increased compatibility. If a .merge file is available the base file in the same archive will be ignored, meaning you can also provide a version of the mod that does not need to be merged.
Some list stuctures (like `ResearchNode`s in `nodes`) require that a key is present (`research_name` for `ResearchNode`, `category` for `ResearchTree`).  
A minimal file that forwards only the mods changes can be automatically created by running the too with the `-makepatch <your-modpack>` argument. The new .merge file will be placed inside the mod pack.  
Such a minimal file that adds my [Bioscanner Drones](https://www.nexusmods.com/theriftbreaker/mods/169) as reward to the Alien Research node would look like this:
```
Research
{
	categories
	{
		ResearchTree
		{
			category "gui/menu/research/category_base_buildings"
			nodes
			{
				ResearchNode
				{
					research_name "gui/menu/research/name/alien_research"
					research_awards
					{
						ResearchAward
						{
							blueprint "buildings/main/tower_drone_scanner"
							is_visible "1"
						}

					}

				}

			}

		}

	}

}
```
